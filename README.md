# CyberUI
A Leap Motion based futuristic UI demo. Currently, the only functionality available is drag and drop. The error screen on dropping at the Execute box is intentional.

## Running
`npm install`

`npm start`

Built using Leap Motion v2 library, unsure if Orion works, but I don't see why not.

## Attribution
