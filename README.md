# CyberUI
A Leap Motion based futuristic UI demo. Currently, the only functionality available is drag and drop. The error screen on dropping at the Execute box is intentional.

This demo is designed for a Leap mounted horizontally, i.e facing you rather than the roof. You'll get best acuracy and usability having it on a desk, tilted back about 20  - 30 degrees.

## Running
`npm install`

`npm start`

Built using Leap Motion v2 library, unsure if Orion works, but I don't see why not.
